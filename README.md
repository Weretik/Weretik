# 👨‍💻 Full-Stack .NET / Angular Engineer

I build production-grade CRM and e-commerce systems using **ASP.NET Core**, **Angular 21+**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**, focusing on clean architecture, modularity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

My engineering approach combines **domain modeling**, **scalable API design**, **event-driven patterns**, and **modern frontend architecture** based on feature modules and reactive state management.
